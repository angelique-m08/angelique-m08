### Angélique Mora - angelique-m08 👩🏻‍

Hi, I'm Angelique, I'm a French student. After a bachelor's and a master's degree in biology, I have just reconverted myself as a web developer. I took a crash course at the Wild Code School in March 2020 and I'm currently doing an internship in a startup where I'm working on a project in React and Typescript.
